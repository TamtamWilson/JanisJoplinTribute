<div class= "bio">
      <p>Janis Lyn Joplin was born January 19, 1943 in Port Authur, Tx.</p>

      <p>As a teenager, Joplin befriended a group of outcasts, one of whom had albums by blues artists Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Lead Belly, whom Joplin later credited with influencing her decision to become a singer. She attented High School at Thomas
        Jefferson High School. During High School she was mostly shunned and taunted because she was different. She was a painter and began singing Blues and Folk music with friends.</p>

      <p>Joplin graduated from high school in 1960 and attended Lamar State College of Technology in Beaumont, Texas, during the summer and later the University of Texas at Austin (UT), but she did not complete college.The campus newspaper, The Daily Texan,
        ran a profile of her in the issue dated July 27, 1962, headlined "She Dares to Be Different. " The article began, "She goes barefooted when she feels like it, wears Levis to class because they 're more comfortable, and carries her Autoharp with
        her everywhere she goes so that in case she gets the urge to break into song, it will be handy. Her name is Janis Joplin." While at UT she performed with a folk trio called the Waller Boys. She recorded her first song "What Good Can Drinkin' Do
        " on tape, at the home of a fellow University of Texas student in December 1962.</p>

      <p>Janis left Texas in January 1963 and moved to North Beach, San Francisco then later to Haight-Ashbury. In 1964 she recorded 7 songs wich was later released as a bootleg Album called The Typewriter Tape.</p>

      <p>In early 1965, Joplin's friends were noticing the detrimental effects on her from regular drug and alcohol use. They persuaded her to return to Port Arthur, Texas. In May 1965, Joplin's friends threw her a bus-fare party so she could go back home
        to Port Arthur. While in Port Arthur she played Live shows in Austin and recorded 7 tracks in studio. These tracks were later issued as a new album in 1995, entitled This is Janis Joplin 1965 by James Gurley.</p>

          <p>After splitting from Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company, Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius "Snooky" Flowers, as well as Big Brother
            &amp; the Holding Company guitarist Sam Andrew and future Full Tilt Boogie Band bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the Stax-Volt R&amp;B bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays. The Stax-Volt R&amp;B sound with
            the use of horns and had a more bluesy, funky, soul, pop-oriented sound than most of the hard-rock psychedelic bands of the period. </p>
